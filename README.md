These are some of the projects i have been doing while learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I am self-taught so feel free to reach out if you see anything I need to do corrections on, or make improvements to.

The Sample Page is my first projecct in which I wanted to create a main page for a brand and then implement CSS to style it.

My first project consists of a javascripted navbar and styling with css.
